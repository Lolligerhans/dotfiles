# Vim bash envronment that we use to have aliases from vim

# I hope this allows us to use bash aliases in vim. Remove if not working.
# I dont know what other effects this will have. If something breaks this line
# might be at fault.
# FIXME Consider using functions instead to not have to use this
shopt -s expand_aliases;
